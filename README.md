[Machine Learning Foundations](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/Day-1-dstraining)
Welcome to the Machine Learning Foundations repository. This project is a comprehensive guide designed to take you from the basic concepts of Data Science to advanced industry-standard algorithms.

Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) is the backbone of modern Artificial Intelligence. These fields help computers analyze data, learn patterns, and make intelligent decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task. This repository serves as a theoretical foundation, while the linked repositories provide practical, hands-on implementations.

[Python Libraries & Machine Learning Workflow](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/Day-2-dstraining) 
Libraries: Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation and math, while Matplotlib visualizes trends and Scikit-Learn implements the machine learning models.
Workflow: The process moves from Preprocessing and EDA to Train-Test Splitting, followed by model Training, Evaluation, and final Hyperparameter Tuning.

Phase 1: Supervised Learning (Regression & Distance)
1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/LinearReg)
    * The Trend Seeker: Predicts continuous numbers (e.g., future height or gold prices) using the formula y = mx + c. 
2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/LogisticReg)
    * The Gatekeeper: Predicts categories (Yes/No) by converting linear output into probabilities using the Sigmoid function.
3. [KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/KNN)
    * The Peer Pressure: "Tell me who your friends are, I'll tell you who you are." Uses Euclidean distance to classify points.
4. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/NaiveBayes)
    * The Rule of Probability: Assumes all features are independent to calculate the highest probability for a class.
5. [SVM (Support Vector Machine)](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/SVM)
    * The Border Patrol: Builds the widest possible "wall" (hyperplane) to separate different classes.

Phase 2: Ensemble & Boosting (The Powerhouses)
1. [Decision Tree](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/Dtree)
    * The Flowchart: A "Choose Your Own Adventure" logic that splits data into branches based on questions.
      
 2(a).[Random Forest Classification](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/RFcla)
2(b).[Random Forest Regression](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/RFreg)
   * The Wisdom of the Crowd: An ensemble of 100+ trees. The majority vote wins, making it robust against noise.
3. AdaBoost
    * Adaptive Boosting: Sequential learning that focuses 90% of its effort on the mistakes made by the previous tree.
4. [Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/GBclassification)
    * Sequential Correction: Builds trees one-by-one to predict and fix the "Residuals" (errors) of the previous tree.
5. [XGBoost](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/XGBclas)
    * The Grandmaster: An optimized, high-speed version of Gradient Boosting. The current "Gold Standard" in data science.
6. [DBSCAN](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/Dbscan)
    * The game-changer: Unlike K-Means, it doesn't need to know how many clusters there are beforehand, and it is an expert at spotting "outliers" (the loners).

Phase 3: Unsupervised Learning & Optimization
1. [K-Means](https://github.com/Itzzdarshan/KMeans)
    * The Data Grouper: Automatically finds hidden patterns and groups data into $K$ clusters based on similarity.
2. Hierarchical Clustering
    * The Dendrogram: Groups data in a tree-like hierarchy, from individual points to one giant cluster.
3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
    * The Simplifier: Reduces the number of variables in a dataset while keeping the most important information.
